Required external libraries
---------------------------

The following external Java libraries (JAR files) must be placed (or symlinked)
here in the lib/ directory, unless specifically noted as optional.

* The samskivert library:
  http://samskivert.com/code/samskivert/

* Apache Commons libraries: collections, digester and io
  http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/

* Megginson Technologies' XMLWriter 0.2 library:
  http://www.megginson.com/Software/xml-writer-0.2.zip

* Retroweaver libraries for creating 1.4 compatible versions:
  http://retroweaver.sourceforge.net/

* (Optional) jMonkeyEngine 3D scene graph toolkit built on LWJGL:
  http://www.jmonkeyengine.com/

Once the jar files are in place (regardless of what they are named), the build
system will automatically include them in the compile-time classpath.
