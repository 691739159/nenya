The Nenya library
-----------------

The Nenya library provides various facilities for making networked multiplayer
games. Its various packages include:

  * geom, util - basic tools for doing data structure manipulation and some
    geometry math
  * resource - tools for bundling, deploying and managing media (images,
    sounds, etc.) with a game
  * media - a framework for doing "active" rendering in Java
  * media.image - tools for loading, caching, manipulating and displaying images
  * media.sound - tools for loading, caching, and playing audio
  * media.animation, media.sprite - works in concert with the active
    rendering system and provides tools for defining and manipulating
    sprites (graphical entities that follow paths) and animations
    (graphical entities that affect the display in other ways)
  * miso - a framework for defining and displaying isometrically rendered scenes
  * cast - a framework for defining and using recolorable, composited
    characters with different poses and actions

Documentation is somewhat sparse at the moment, but inspection of the code in
the tests/ directory shows examples of use of many features of the library.

Building
--------

Building the library is very simple. First ensure that the necessary third
party jar files are available in the lib/ directory. See lib/README for a list
of the necessary third party jar files and how to get them.

The library is built using Ant, a modern build tool written in and for Java. If
you aren't already using Ant for other projects, it can be found here:

  http://ant.apache.org/

Invoke ant with any of the following targets:

  all: builds the distribution files and javadoc documentation
  compile: builds only the class files (dist/classes)
  javadoc: builds only the javadoc documentation (dist/docs)
  dist: builds the distribution jar files (dist/*.jar)

Distribution
------------

The Nenya library is released under the LGPL. The most recent version of the
library is available here:
