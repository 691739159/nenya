Media Notes -*- mode: outline -*-

* Old notes
- Possibly modify TileSet to load images via image manager (move image
  provider up to media so that image manager can use tileset's image
  provider to load the image data) so that they can be cached (and more
  importantly, flushed from the cache). Presently tilesets are loaded into
  memory when tileset bundles are loaded and remain loaded forever.

- Make sure doLayout() is getting called soon enough to ensure that we
  don't improperly scroll the wrong thing if we're hijacked while in the
  middle of scrolling
